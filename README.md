# HR-Dashboard Power BI
This data is about the Attrition of Employees of organization, So I came up with some key insights:
·       According to Gender “Male” employee’s no. are more than “Female” employees.
·       Around 69% employees who left the Organization because their salary is Up to 5000.
·       Mostly employees left the Organization after 1 Year completion.
·       26–35-year-old employees have maximum no. of attrition.
·       According to analysis 38% of employees left the organization are from “life sciences” background in education
The whole process involved the following:
·       Fetch the Data
·       Cleaning the data
·       Used functions
·       Used KPIs, Donut chart, Clustered bar chart, Area charts, Tree map, Filters, Slicers, Clustered column charts etc
